## 📣 About the basecamp

The basecamp was an amazing experience where one of the requirements to be a cadet is to help and be helped, to learn how to learn and to be very dedicated.

The table bellow sums up all my progress during 42's Piscine in São Paulo, Brazil between April 4 and April 22, 2022. I intend to finish all the exercises from the 16 lists during my journey as a cadet at 42!

## 🫂 Acknowledgements

I really want to thank everybody I had the chance to talk with, especially the ones from my village that endured the 21 days of basecamp until the end. I wouldn't have lasted so long without all of you, thanks a lot!
